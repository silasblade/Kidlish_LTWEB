<p style="font-size: 21px;margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px;margin-top: 25px;color: rgb(220, 232, 233);font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;text-align: justify;">
    Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who loved to read. She read books about princesses, adventures, animals, and even science fiction stories. Every night before bed, Lily would pick out a new book from her bookshelf and spend some time reading it.
    <br>    <br>

    One day, Lily went to the library with her mom to borrow some new books. She looked around and found a book about dinosaurs. She had never read a book about dinosaurs before, but she was curious about them. She checked out the book and brought it home with her.
    <br>    <br>

    That night, Lily started reading the book about dinosaurs. She learned all about the different types of dinosaurs that roamed the earth millions of years ago. She read about the T-Rex, the Stegosaurus, and even the Triceratops. She was fascinated by all the new information she was learning.
    <br>    <br>


    As she continued to read, Lily started to imagine what it would be like to live in a world with dinosaurs. She wondered what it would be like to see a T-Rex in real life or to ride on the back of a Triceratops. She was so engrossed in the book that she didn't even notice when her mom came in to say goodnight.
    <br>    <br>

    
    The next day, Lily went to school and told all her friends about the book she was reading. They were all fascinated by the stories she told them and couldn't wait to read it for themselves. During recess, they played a game of "dinosaur tag," where one person was the T-Rex and had to tag the other players. They had so much fun playing together and pretending to be dinosaurs.
    <br>    <br>

    
    From then on, Lily was hooked on reading books about dinosaurs. She read every book she could find on the topic and even started a collection of toy dinosaurs. She loved learning about these prehistoric creatures and was always eager to share her knowledge with anyone who would listen.</p>
